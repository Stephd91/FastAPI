# Copy the file with the requirements to the /code directory.

# for this step, enabling the cache for the next step too.

# Install the package dependencies in the requirements file.
# The --no-cache-dir option tells pip to not save the downloaded packages locally
# The --upgrade option tells pip to upgrade the packages if they are already installed.

# The CMD directive specifies the default command to run when starting a container (docker run) from this image.
# Set the command to run the uvicorn server.
# This command will be run from the current working directory,
# the same /code directory you set above with WORKDIR /code.
# Because the program will be started at /code and inside of it is the
# directory ./app with your code, Uvicorn will be able to see and import app from app.main

# Uncomment the below line if you want the webapp to be launched with uvicorn automatically
