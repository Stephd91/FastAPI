![Logo](app/static/images/Logo_Data_Engineering_101.png)
This repository contains a FastAPI web application for training purpose ðŸ“š. \
The app is composed of a FastAPI-SQLAlchemy-PostgreSQL backend combined with a server side render Jinja2. \
Here is the project's schema architecture :

## Lessons Learned

Building this project from scratch, I could learn a lot about how API is built to exchange with its clients and its backend database.
Here are the skills I learned from this project :
ðŸ“Œ Database skills : 
    âœ… PostgreSQL handling with CLI
    âœ… UML diagram and entity relationships in a relational database
    âœ… Alembic migrations
ðŸ“Œ Python & API skills : 
    âœ… SQLALchemy ORM language
    âœ… Endpoint logic with FastAPI and crud operations
    âœ… Pydantic model validation 
    âœ… Unit testing with pytest
ðŸ“Œ Front-end skills :
    âœ… Some Bootstrap, HTML and Javascript coding
ðŸ“Œ Deployment skills :
    âœ… Used decouple with environment variables to hide connection infos
    âœ… Dockerization
    âœ… CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
