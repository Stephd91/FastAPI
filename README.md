# A simple yet detailed FastAPI App project

<img src="app/static/images/Logo_Data_Engineering_101.png" width=50% height=50%>
This repository contains a FastAPI web application for training purpose ðŸ“š. \
The app is composed of a FastAPI-SQLAlchemy-PostgreSQL backend combined with a server side render Jinja2. \
Here is the project's schema architecture : \

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.9 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

## Setup
Clone the repository then go to the root directory :

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stephd91/FastAPI.git
   cd FastAPI
   ```

Build the Docker Image. The docker build command uses the Dockerfile to build a new image.
Then run the application in a Container using the docker run command.

  ```bash
  docker build -t fastapiproject .
  docker run -d --name fastapicontainer -p 80:80 fastapiproject
  ```
Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.
Frontend, built with Docker, with routes handled based on the path: http://localhost:80
Automatic interactive documentation with Swagger UI (from the OpenAPI backend): http://localhost:80/docs
  ```bash
  127.0.0.1:80
  ```
## CI/CD Pipeline
Automatically build and tag a Docker image and test it
  ```bash
  ddd
  ```

## Lessons Learned

Building this project from scratch, I could learn a lot about how API is built to exchange with its clients and its backend database.
Here are the skills I learned from this project :
* ðŸ“Œ **Database skills**:
  *âœ… PostgreSQL handling with CLI
  *âœ… UML diagram and entity relationships in a relational database
  *âœ… Alembic migrations
* ðŸ“Œ **Python & API skills** :
  *âœ… SQLALchemy ORM language
  *âœ… Endpoint logic with FastAPI and crud operations
  *âœ… Pydantic model validation
  *âœ… Unit testing with pytest
* ðŸ“Œ **Front-end skills** :
  *âœ… Some Bootstrap, HTML and Javascript coding
* ðŸ“Œ **Deployment skills** :
  *âœ… Used "decouple" package to hide connection infos with environment variables
  *âœ… Dockerization
  *âœ… CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
