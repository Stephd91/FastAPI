1. Install pytest
2. Create a directory "tests" at the root of your repository
3. Add as many test.py files as needed then write the tests (see : https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/ and https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/tests/ and https://mingzhi2.medium.com/how-to-create-a-test-database-pytest-pytest-postgresql-sqlalchemy-77f814b57b10)
4. In the files :
- Use FastAPI's TestClient to simulate HTTP requests to your FastAPI app ⚠️ A test database should be used
- Create functions with a name starting with test_ (this is standard pytest conventions)
